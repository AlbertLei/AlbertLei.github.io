- Banach–Mazur Game.
  - Let *A* be a subset of *R*. There are two players, Alice and Bob.
  - Round 1: Bob chooses a closed interval of positive length: U₁ ⊆ R.
    Then, Alice chooses a closed interval of positive length: V₁⊆ U₁.
  - Round 2: Bob chooses a closed interval of positive length: U₂ ⊆ V₁.
    Then, Alice chooses a closed interval of positive length: V₂⊆ U₂.
  - ... after countably-infinite many rounds, 
    let E := ∩ᵢVᵢ. Alice wins if E ∩ A is empty. Otherwise, Bob wins.
  - If A is the set of rational number, will Alice have a winning strategy? What if 
    A is an interval, say (a,b)?
