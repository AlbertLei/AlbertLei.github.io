<!--  
  - Abstract: We reexamine the delegation model (Holmstrom, 1977) between a decision maker and an expert, with the latter having state-independent preferences. 
  In this setting, the widely-studied interval delegation fails to elicit the expert’s information. 
  We derive the optimal stochastic mechanism and discuss its implementa tion. 
  Notably, the veto-based delegation ubiquitous in various organizations implements the decision maker’s preferred mechanism. Our model applies to many real world settings in which the expert only cares about the decision maker’s chosen action.

<!--  
  - Abstract: I incorporate last-minute sales into a two-period sequential screening model. Early buyers privately observe an imperfect signal regarding their valuation in period one, and then privately observe their valuation in period two. 
  Last-minute buyers arrive in period two and already know their valuation. In the seller's optimal mechanism with full commitment, early buyers likely to have high valuations are separated by different refund contracts and those likely to have low valuations are pooled by a full-refund contract. We also discuss the seller's optimal mechanism when she cannot commit to the period-two contract at the beginning. In this case, the "interval early buyers" are delayed to last-minute sales in order to discourage price cutting in period two. The seller can achieve that by offering low-price guarantees to the delayed buyers. Our findings shed new light on the seller's revenue management in dynamic environments.
